# Airflow Migration Project

## Overview

This repository documents the migration of **120+ legacy cron jobs** into standardized **Apache Airflow DAGs**. The project delivered significant improvements in maintainability, observability, and reliability of scheduled workflows, while reducing runtime inefficiencies and on-call burdens.

Key outcomes:

* Migrated 120+ cron jobs to Airflow DAGs.
* Introduced retries, exponential backoffs, and lineage tracking.
* Proactive monitoring with alerts and dashboards.
* Improved p95 runtime by **55%**.
* Reduced failures by **70%**.
* Decreased on-call incidents by **60%**.
* Implemented CI/CD pipeline for automated DAG deployment with validations.

## Project Background

Originally, our data platform relied on **cron jobs** spread across multiple servers. This caused issues:

* Lack of central visibility.
* No retry or backoff mechanisms.
* Failures often required manual intervention.
* Scaling was error-prone.

By consolidating into **Airflow**, we centralized orchestration, improved reliability, and ensured governance.

---

## Architecture

### High-Level Design

* **Scheduler**: Airflow Scheduler replaces cron, ensuring DAG-level orchestration.
* **Workers**: KubernetesExecutor handles scalable execution.
* **Monitoring**: Integrated with Prometheus + Grafana.
* **Alerting**: Slack + PagerDuty integration.
* **Data Lineage**: Implemented with OpenLineage for job traceability.

## Migration Approach

1. **Discovery**: Collected inventory of 120+ cron jobs.
2. **Prioritization**: Grouped by business criticality.
3. **Standardization**: Defined DAG templates.
4. **Incremental Migration**: Migrated jobs in phases.
5. **Testing & Validation**: Ensured idempotency and compliance.

---

## Airflow DAG Standardization

* **Retries**: Configured exponential backoff.
* **Lineage**: Automated metadata logging.
* **SLAs**: Defined per DAG for alerting.
* **Logging**: Centralized in ELK stack.

### Example DAG Template

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta


def sample_task():
    print("Executing task...")

with DAG(
    dag_id="example_dag",
    schedule_interval="0 * * * *",
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    retries=3,
    retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=5),
) as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="sample_task",
        python_callable=sample_task,
    )
```

---

## CI/CD for DAG Deployment

* **Validation**: DAGs linted and validated before deployment.
* **Automated Testing**: Unit tests for Python callables.
* **Deployment**: GitHub Actions + Terraform for environment promotion.
* **Idempotency**: Jobs designed for safe re-runs.

---

## Monitoring & Observability

* **Airflow UI**: Centralized DAG visibility.
* **Custom Metrics**: Exposed task runtime, retries.
* **Alerting**: Slack + PagerDuty notifications.
* **Lineage Tracking**: OpenLineage integration.

---

## Performance Gains

Measured improvements:

* p95 runtime reduced **55%**.
* Failures decreased **70%**.
* On-call incidents dropped **60%**.

---

## Sample DAGs

1. **ETL Pipeline** (extract → transform → load).
2. **Data Quality Checks** (null checks, schema drift).
3. **Reporting Job** (daily aggregated metrics).

Each DAG follows the same standardized template.

---

## Testing & Validation

* **Unit Tests**: For task logic.
* **Integration Tests**: Validating DAG execution.
* **Contract Tests**: Schema & SLA compliance.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add **dynamic DAG generation**.
* Enhance **real-time monitoring**.
* Implement **cost-aware scheduling**.
* Expand **data lineage coverage**.

## Conclusion

This migration transformed our legacy job scheduling into a modern, observable, and scalable orchestration platform. With Airflow at the core, we achieved **higher reliability, better monitoring, and reduced operational overhead**.
